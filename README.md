# Basic Blog
This websie allows an user to create, edit, view, and delete blog posts.
## About The Project
This project is the combination of two tutorials I took during my Full Stack Web Development class on Udemy. I'm creating a basic blog that has authentication and uses a database to contain the registered users and blogs posts.

The project is currently under development.
